# Star creator
## A star creation tool with a handy preset manager
To create your own stars (or reuse some of your coworkers ðŸ˜‰).  
Open the star creator tool in Window -> Star Creator :

This will open you a window where you'll be able to manage star presets and add stars to your scene.  
Changes to the presets are saved in real time in the project.

Once added to your scene, you'll still be able to modify the properties of your stars in their inspectors.  
A change made here won't affect back the preset.  

### Export and import your presets
Presets are saved in the unity project.  
If you wish to share your creation or simply make a backup outside of the project.  
You can do so by using the Export feature of the tool:   
* Click on export
* Select the presets you wish to export
* Click on Save as... and select the export location
  
You'll then be able to import them from the tool using the import feature:  
* Click on import
* Click on Load file... to select a preset file
* Select the presets you wish to import
* Click on import
  
No need to worry about name conflict, the tool will ask you what to do should the need arise.  

Have fun!
